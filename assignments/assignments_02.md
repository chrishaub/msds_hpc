## Cancer Deep Learning Environment (CANDLE)
CANDLE is a high performance computer that uses the power of exascale computing with neural network based machine learning used for cancer research. 

## Quartz at Indiana University
Quartz is a high throughput computing cluster. It features 92 compute nodes, each equipeed with two 64 core AMD EPYC 7742 2.25 GHz CPU's and 512 GB RAM. It has a peak per node perfomance of greater than 4,608 gigaFLOPS. The nodes are housed in Indiana Universities Bloomington Data Center. It is connected to the IU science department with a 10 gigabit ethernet. There is a quota allotment of 800 GB per user. 

Improved Neutron Lifetime Measurement with UCN was research that looked at how long, on average, a free neutron lives outside the confines of atomic nuclei. It was measured to an uncertainty of one-tenth of one percent. It resulted in refinements in understanding of the standard model for neutron decay.


## Schooner at University of Oklahoma
Schooner has 499 compute nodes and can compute 346.9 trillions of calculations per second. It has 10,180 CPU cores with 23TB of RAM, 450TB of usable storage. It has two networks, Infiniband and Ethernet. It's compute nodes are PowerEdge R430 with 266 x dual Intel Xeon "Haswell" E5-2670v3 12 core 2.3 GHz, 64 GB RAM

The research papaer Toward Carbon-Negative and Emission-Curbing Roads to Drive Environmental Health research was completed on the Schooner machine. It examined the role of ultraviolet radiation on roadway infrastructure during service life. They hypothesized that carbonaceous particles grafted by molecules such as amines andamides can serve as scavengers of free radicals, delaying aging in composites. The hypothesis turned out to be correct.
